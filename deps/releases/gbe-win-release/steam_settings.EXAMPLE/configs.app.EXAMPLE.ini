[app::dlcs]
# 1=report all DLCs as unlocked
# 0=report only the DLCs mentioned
# some games check for "hidden" DLCs, hence this should be set to 1 in that case
# but other games detect emus by querying for a fake/bad DLC, hence this should be set to 0 in that case

[app::paths]
# some rare games might need to be provided one or more paths to appids
# for example the path to where a DLC is installed
# this sets the paths returned by the Steam_Apps::GetAppInstallDir function

3456=../folder_one_level_above_where_steam_api_is

# however some other games might expect this function to return empty paths to properly load DLCs
# you can deliberately set the path to be empty to specify this behavior like lines below

# there are reserved identifiers which are replaced at runtime
# you can find a list of them here:

# the identifiers must be wrapped with double colons "::" like this:
#   original value: {SteamCloudDocuments}
#   ini value:      {::SteamCloudDocuments::}
# notice the braces "{" and "}", they are not changed
# the double colons are added between them as shown above
